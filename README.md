# Sidcup-Family-Golf-website-clone
This project is a clone of the Sidcup Family Golf website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project replicates the design, layout, and features of the original website, which is focused on providing information and services related to family-oriented golf activities. Users can explore details about the golf club, including facilities, membership options, upcoming events, and booking services. The clone includes interactive maps, photo galleries, and forms for inquiries or reservations, enhancing the user experience similar to the original site. It showcases my skills in front-end web development and attention to detail in recreating a specific niche website for golf enthusiasts and families.
